## Overview

The `SpeziAccount` framework fully abstracts setup and management of user account functionality for the
[Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/Spezi/) framework ecosystem.

@Row {
    @Column {
        @Image(source: "AccountSetup", alt: "Screenshot displaying the account setup view with an email and password prompt and a Sign In with Apple button.") {
            The ``AccountSetup`` is the central view for account onboarding, facilitating account login and creation.
        }
    }
    @Column {
        @Image(source: "SignupForm", alt: "Screenshot displaying the Signup Form for Account setup.") {
            The ``SignupForm`` is used by email-password-based AccountServices by default.
        }
    }
    @Column {
        @Image(source: "AccountOverview", alt: "Screenshot displaying the Account Overview.") {
            The ``AccountOverview`` is used to view and modify the user details of the currently associated account. 
        }
    }
}

The ``AccountSetup`` and ``AccountOverview`` views are central to `SpeziAccount`.
You use the ``AccountDetails`` abstraction within your views to visualize account information of the associated user account.

An ``AccountService`` provides an abstraction layer for managing different types of account management services
(e.g., email address and password-based service combined with an identity provider like Sign in with Apple).

> Note: The [SpeziFirebase](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziFirebase)
framework provides the [`FirebaseAccountConfiguration`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezifirebase/documentation/spezifirebaseaccount/firebaseaccountconfiguration)
you can use to configure an Account Service base on the Google Firebase service.

## Setup

You need to add the Spezi Account Swift package to
[your app in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app#) or
[Swift package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-a-standalone-swift-package-with-xcode#Add-a-dependency-on-another-Swift-package).
  
> Important: If your application is not yet configured to use Spezi, follow the [Spezi setup article](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezi/documentation/spezi/initial-setup) to set up the core Spezi infrastructure.

The <doc:Initial-Setup> article provides a quick-start guide to set up `SpeziAccount` in your App.

Refer to the <doc:Creating-your-own-Account-Service> article if you plan on implementing your own Account Service.
