/// The primary entry point for UI components and ``AccountService``s to interact with ``SpeziAccount`` interfaces.
///
/// The `Account` object is responsible to manage the state of the currently logged in user.
/// You can simply access the currently ``signedIn`` state of the user (or via the `$signedIn` publisher) or
/// access the account information from the ``details`` property (or via the `$details` publisher).
///
/// - Note: For more information on how to access and use the `Account` object when implementing a custom ``AccountService``
///     refer to the <doc:Creating-your-own-Account-Service> article.
///
/// ### Accessing `Account` in your view
///
/// To access the `Account` object from anywhere in your view hierarchy (assuming you have ``AccountConfiguration`` configured),
/// you may just declare the respective [@Environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment)
/// property wrapper as in the code sample below.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct MyView: View {
///     @Environment(Account.self) var account
///
///     var body: some View {
///         if let details = account.details {
///             Text("Hello \(details.name.formatted(.name(style: .medium)))")
///         } else {
///             Text("Hello World")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Retrieving Account state
/// This section provides an overview on how to retrieve the currently logged in user from your views.
///
/// - ``signedIn``
/// - ``details``
///
/// ### Managing Account state
/// This section provides an overview on how to manage and manipulate the current user account as an ``AccountService``.

/// - ``supplyUserDetails(_:isNewUser:)``
/// - ``removeUserDetails()``
