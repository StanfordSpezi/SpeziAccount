/// This is the underlying storage type for the ``AccountServiceConfiguration`` to store instances of ``AccountServiceConfigurationKey``.

/// Configuration options that are provided by an ``AccountService``.
///
/// A instance of this type is required to be provided by every ``AccountService``. It is used to
/// set and communicate certain configuration options of the account service to the UI components that
/// represent the account service (e.g., determining the type of userId through ``UserIdConfiguration`` or
/// providing `ValidationRule`s for a field through the ``FieldValidationRules`` configuration).
///
/// For more information on how to provide custom configuration options, refer to the documentation of
/// ``AccountServiceConfigurationKey``.
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Retrieving configuration
/// Below is a list of configuration options built into the ``SpeziAccount`` framework.
///
/// - ``name``
/// - ``image``
/// - ``userIdConfiguration``
/// - ``fieldValidationRules(for:)-28x74``
/// - ``fieldValidationRules(for:)-w2n2``
///
/// ### Result Builder
/// - ``AccountServiceConfigurationKey``
/// - ``AccountServiceConfigurationBuilder``
///
/// ### Shared Repository
/// - ``AccountServiceConfigurationStorageAnchor``
/// - ``AccountServiceConfigurationStorage``
