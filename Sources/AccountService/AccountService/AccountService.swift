/// A `AccountService` is a set of components that is capable of setting up and managing the ``AccountDetails`` for the global ``Account`` context.
///
/// This protocol imposes the minimal requirements for an `AccountService` where most of the account-related procedures
/// are entirely application defined. This protocol requires functionality for account signup, modifications,
/// logout and removal.
///
/// You may improve the user experience or rely on user interface defaults if you adopt protocols like
/// ``EmbeddableAccountService`` or ``UserIdPasswordAccountService``.
///
/// - Important: Every user account is expected to have a primary and unique user identifier.
///     SpeziAccount requires a stable and internal ``AccountIdKey`` unique user identifier and offers
///     a user visible ``UserIdKey`` which can be customized using the ``UserIdConfiguration``.
///
/// You can learn more about creating an account service at: <doc:Creating-your-own-Account-Service>.
